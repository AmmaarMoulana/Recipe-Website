        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>Plant material will be added to a Water/NaoH mixture. This will break down the plant cells and release dmt to the solution</p>
        <p>Naptha will be added and mixed gently. The DMT moves into the naptha</p>
        <p>Naptha can be pippeted out into a jar/plate. The naptha evaporates leaving DMT crystals behind</p>
